# üöö Carry

> **Carry** is a decentralized delivery network that rewards both couriers and communities using real-world incentives, zkCompression for scalable data, and DAO-driven governance.

## üåç What is Carry?

Carry reimagines last-mile delivery by turning idle cars into active crypto nodes. It enables users to:

- üì¶ Create and accept delivery jobs on-chain
- üîê Use zkCompression to reduce storage and transaction costs
- üöó Earn passive crypto by running ‚ÄúCar-as-a-Node‚Äù
- üß† Participate in DAO governance to vote on features and fees
- üõ∞ Track deliveries in real time with decentralized communication

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Solana + Anchor**: Smart contract framework
- **zkCompression (Light Protocol)**: Verifiable, low-cost off-chain data
- **React Native**: Mobile app frontend
- **Solana Mobile Wallet Adapter**: Wallet authentication
- **TypeScript**: Client-side logic and contract interaction
- **DAO Framework**: Community governance and voting

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

````bash
git clone https://github.com/osas2211/carry.git
cd carry


This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Mobile setup

   ```bash
   cd mobile```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
````

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
